Git commands for creating a new repository, adding the files to the repository, committing the changes, setting up a remote origin, and pushing the changes to the remote repository. Here's a breakdown of each command and what it does:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

git add .: Adds all files in the current directory to the staging area. The staging area is where you can prepare changes before committing them.

git status: Displays the status of the files in the repository, including which files are staged and which are not.

git commit -m "First commit": Commits the staged changes to the local repository with a message describing the changes made. In this case, it's the first commit in the repository.

git remote add origin https://github.com/example: Adds a remote repository named "origin" with the URL https://github.com/example.

git push -u origin master: Pushes the committed changes to the "master" branch of the "origin" remote repository. The -u flag tells Git to remember the upstream branch and the remote repository, so you don't have to specify them again in the future.
